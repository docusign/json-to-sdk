# Batch app

# npm run-script processSwagger
The processSwagger app reads the swagger file and produces
multiple output files. Some of the files are used by the 
Fluent to JSON library (dsEnvelopePlusJSON) or by the
JSON to SDK library (dsJsonToSDK).

Other output is used for the Blockly library tool.
